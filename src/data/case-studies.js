    description: "This case study showcases our work with PsyExpert, a newly established practice specializing in trauma and anxiety recovery for children, adolescents, and families. We created the founding website to introduce their services, establish trust, and provide a clear pathway for potential clients to reach out. The result is a clean, approachable, and professional online presence that positions PsyExpert as a credible and welcoming resource for families seeking support.",
    challenge: "PsyExpert was launching as a new practice and needed to establish an online presence from scratch. The market lacked clear, professional websites for trauma-focused therapy aimed at families and children. The practice needed to communicate expertise, warmth, and accessibility while presenting information clearly. There was no existing website, branding, or visual direction to build upon. The core problem was how to convey professional credibility and a welcoming environment while guiding users to take action, all without an existing digital foundation.",
    solution: "We developed the founding website from the ground up with a focus on clarity, trust, and user experience. Organized content into intuitive sections—Home, About, Treatment, Contact—to make navigation simple and encourage engagement. Used soft, calming colors and generous white space to reflect a safe, approachable atmosphere for families and children. Highlighted PsyExpert founder Vanity Veraar, including her profile and qualifications, to build trust and humanize the practice. Prominent CTAs such as 'Plan a free conversation' guide visitors toward making contact. Emphasized outcomes and reassurance to communicate empathy and expertise clearly.",

    description: "This case study presents my work as founding designer for Roam, a personal AI travel guide app. I lead the design strategy, interface, and system design, shaping consistent and intuitive experiences across mobile platforms. Roam allows users to chat with AI as if talking to a local guide and offers customizable audio tours with selectable tones, from local to curator or historian. This is an ongoing project, and I contribute once a week, gaining experience in designing AI-driven products and working closely with a talented multidisciplinary team.",
    challenge: "Roam needed to stand out in a crowded travel app market. Traditional apps provide static guides or audio tours that lack interactivity and personalization. Users wanted the ability to explore cities dynamically while receiving real-time guidance, asking questions, and experiencing tours in different narrative tones. Existing solutions failed to combine adaptive AI-driven paths with interactive, customizable content, creating a gap that Roam aimed to fill.",
    solution: "Designed Roam to leverage AI for personalized tours with adaptive paths, customizable audio, and AI chat functionality that mimics a local guide. Focused on keeping the interface simple and intuitive while handling complex AI logic in the background. Developed the UI/UX, interactive prototypes, and a comprehensive design system covering typography, color, iconography, and component patterns. Built a cohesive system with warm, earthy tones to reflect grounded, smart, and locally inspired experiences. Worked weekly with developers, AI engineers, and product leads to iterate on AI features and ensure usability.",

    services: ["UX/UI Design", "User Research", "Dashboard Design"],
    description: "Solve.money, a financial application that enables businesses to apply for loans and receive preapprovals within seconds, partnered with me to redesign their dashboard. The previous interface caused confusion and reduced trust. By applying user-centered design principles and Jakob's Law, I delivered a familiar, intuitive experience that improved usability and increased adoption.",
    challenge: "Solve.money aimed to streamline the loan application process for businesses but struggled with a dashboard that left users frustrated. Navigation felt inconsistent and unfamiliar. Key actions like loan applications and preapprovals were difficult to locate. The design lacked alignment with user expectations from other financial platforms. Despite offering fast preapprovals, the experience was a barrier, leading to lower engagement and hesitation among new users.",
    solution: "My approach centered on simplifying complexity and aligning the platform with familiar interaction patterns. Applied Jakob's Law to reimagine the dashboard around common financial app conventions. Redesigned the navigation to surface loan applications and preapprovals as primary actions. Introduced a clear hierarchy and visual structure for quick scanning. Used consistent design patterns to reduce cognitive load. Worked closely with stakeholders to balance business goals with user needs.",
    results: ["Increased adoption: More businesses actively used the dashboard after launch", "Enhanced satisfaction: User feedback highlighted clarity and ease of use", "Streamlined navigation: Users completed core tasks faster with fewer clicks"],

    description: "Eventify, a startup by Evolutica Pty Ltd, set out to connect music enthusiasts with local events, from small gigs to large festivals. I joined as both Designer and Developer, responsible for designing a user-friendly product and implementing the UI in React Native. The app also empowers artists and promoters to create accounts, promote events, and reach wider audiences, bridging the gap between fans and event organisers.",
    challenge: "As a new startup, Eventify faced two major constraints: Limited budget for research and testing, and need to move fast to launch a working product in a competitive space. The challenge was to design and build an experience that felt reliable and familiar to users, while still being unique enough to stand out in the crowded event-discovery market.",
    solution: "Given the startup constraints, I approached the design process with a lean mindset. Conducted competitive research analyzing existing event platforms (Songkick, Dice, Eventbrite) to identify what worked and what could be improved. Combined the best-performing patterns and avoided pitfalls observed in other apps. Created a clean, music-centric interface with clear pathways for both fans and organisers. Implemented the UI in React Native, ensuring performance and consistency across platforms.",

    services: ["UX/UI Design", "Mobile-First Design", "Payment UX"],
    description: "This case study showcases my design work for Peach Payments, a leading African fintech company offering online payment solutions. I was tasked with improving their hosted payment page, Checkout, by addressing how unavailable payment methods are communicated to end-users. The project allowed me to design an updated mobile-first interface for a high-traffic checkout experience. While the team praised the design direction and approach, the experience became a turning point in my career, teaching me the importance of articulating design decisions effectively to stakeholders—a skill I continue to develop and apply in all my work.",
    challenge: "Peach Payments' hosted Checkout enables customers to pay via multiple methods including Card, Bank transfer (EFT), Scan to Pay, and Vouchers. The issue: when certain payment methods went offline or became temporarily unavailable, there was no clear UI feedback. This often led to confusion and increased checkout abandonment. Key constraints included 75% of users on mobile requiring optimization for small screens, customer preference for specific methods potentially leading to abandonment, inconsistent merchant vs. Checkout indications, and an outdated design system built in 2019 using Material's Backdrop that was misaligned with Peach's broader product design system.",
    solution: "I approached the problem with a mobile-first design strategy focused on clarity, transparency, and user trust. Analyzed existing checkout flows to identify friction points and defined UX goals to reduce abandonment and maintain trust. Designed a payment method list with clear availability states: Available (active, selectable) and Unavailable (visually dimmed with explanatory messages). Added contextual microcopy to reassure users and created a mobile-optimized layout with emphasis on one-tap clarity. Iterated on a modernized UI aesthetic, moving beyond the old Material Backdrop pattern towards a cleaner, more intuitive system.",
    results: ["Delivered a functional, mobile-first design solution to a real industry problem", "Received strong feedback on creativity, usability, and alignment with user needs", "Confirmed approach addressed abandonment risk by making unavailability transparent", "Became a significant growth experience in communicating design decisions effectively"],
